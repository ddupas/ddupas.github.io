![Google Sheets Job Search Tracker](/images/mars-rover-og.jpg)

I've developed a job search tracker using Google Sheets. Somehow, I forgot how incredible it is
to work in a spreadsheet. I've been so locked into databases where each part of the creation is speparated: the actual data, the table descriptions, and the user interface... whereas we can iteratively create all 3 in the spreadsheet. If it becomes unweildly, then maybe a bad choice,
but in the meantime, it was wildly fast to build and use.

Features:
- calandar date picker
- task list
- notes
- reminders (calendar embed)
- contacts
