introduction: |
    Ari is a husky puppy that just wants to go outside all the time. Here she is
    whining because the girls 
    left for school. Also, this is my legendary pancake recipe.

### Ingredients

None of my actual cooking requires measurements, we just go by look and feel.

In smaller bowl wet ingredients:
- 1 or 2 eggs
- tablespoon of oil
- 1 cup of milk
- 1/2 cup of buttermilk
- mix that

In larger bowl dry ingredients:
- 1.5 or 2 cups of flour
- 1 tablespoon of baking powder
- half a teaspoon of salt
- 1 tablespoon of sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda (use back of spoon handle)
- mix that

Combine in large bowl, use the back of a tablespoon to mix along the edges of 
bowl to smooth lumps, add milk until you get something that will pour, but no 
runnier. If that makes sense. 

**Info Notice:** 
Heat pan before pouring, and be generous with oil in pan. Oil should sizzle a 
little. Usually medium heat for a few minutes then turn down to medium low.

Though, there can be some problems along the way. This pancake was slightly
large and or flipped too soon.

Much better here, a little smaller.
