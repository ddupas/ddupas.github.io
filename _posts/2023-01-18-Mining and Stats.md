# [FISH] Milan Kundera 

I’ve always been a gamer, it relieves stress and does not cost much. It does 
cost the time you could have put into something else though. How can we manage
the time?

I started playing War Brokers because it was Linux-compatible. Warbrokers is
renowned for its active community of interesting players. Here is a link to my
OG player profile: 
[Milan Kundera](https://stats.warbrokers.io/players/i/60a6a302d142af1f1d389c83)

You can see that we’ve had a lot of fun, but there were some tedious aspects of
keeping track of stats, so the project just grew incrementally. It started as a
20-line replit, then it became a serverless firebase project, and now it is a
node / sqlite / github hybrid project.

SQL is my friend, So firebase was limiting for me. Also, a lot of these
wonderful services offered online can bite you. In my case, firebase was free
but after changing some deployment settings I got a bill.

Now MSFISH actively tracks my friends but also tracks the amount of time I play -
I am trying to keep it under 150 kills per day. 🤐

The entire project is hosted on Github with a more detailed breakdown of how it 
works in the README.

If you are interested in data mining there are a few interesting things to
chew on here. There is a lot of subtle async / await / promise code in this
project. I feel that the way the charts page accesses its data, using embedded
sqlite is also something I have never seen anywhere, but sql.js, is vn. 🙃

🤡 Ask me about it! 🤡
