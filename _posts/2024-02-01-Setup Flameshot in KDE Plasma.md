# Steps Overview

1. Disable Spectacle
2. Install Flameshot
3. Configure Shortcuts
4. Configure Clipboard

# Disable Spectacle

Though I have enjoyed spectacle, I've moved onto Flameshot. Spectacle does have a quiet mode, but it does not have the annotation and imgur upload features. I also like the rectangle selection with Flameshot.

To disable Spectacle, we could uninstall it. Or, disable the keyboard shortcut, which is done the same place we will add 2 new shortcuts in step 3.

To open Shortcut settings in Plasma Desktop, we can use Alt + Spacebar, they type Shortcut
