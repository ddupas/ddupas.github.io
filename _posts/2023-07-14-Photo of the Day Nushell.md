I've taken a tour of Nushell and enjoyed it. Bash is still ubiquitous, but Nushell is much more exciting. After about a week, I took a break to reflect, but I have reached for it;

So, the exciting thing about the Nushell experience compared to other computer stuff in the past is community! They helped me almost immediately; I couldn't get a taco faster than I got feedback.

I want to keep using Nushell as a general-purpose scripting language; though it may become more, its scope seems to be growing. Get comfortable not knowing everything because there is a lot to explore. Adding more normal Unix features is being investigated; for instance, this feature request to merge stdout and stderr (https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/9673).

Finally, my first script as a gist, followed by a link to my Podnu GitHub repository: all influenced by the Nushell Discord community.
