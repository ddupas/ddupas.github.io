# Linux on the Desktop

Firstly, it matters because of culture. I am more productive in Linux because of
how I feel at work. I have an inexpensive laptop that runs Linux well, maybe not
everything, but enough that it's comfortable.

Before I replaced the touchpad button board on this laptop, Windows would not
boot off the hard drive or iso key.{: .notice--info}

I just want to create. 

That being said, I have used a thousand configurations, and when I am tired, I
will try anything because its fun. That is Linux culture I have, the culture of
experimenting.  The balance between always trying new things and 
using the tools to create can be tricky ðŸ¥¸. 

```txt
I am not a programmer.
Nor am I a writer.
Where is Serge Ibaka?
Lets Go Blue Jays!
```

# rm -rf ~

So, just to be clear, I enjoy starting over. So when I have a fresh install, what
are some of the things I can not live without?
    
    0. ARCH LINUX with yay and Gnome
    1. Set shell with chsh to fish
    2. Set editor in fish.config to micro
    3. Install builder and git with keys
    4. Bing wallpaper and Hide Top Bar Gnome Extensions

# rtfm arch linux ftw

If you haven't noticed, Arch Linux documentation is very good. Check it out!
